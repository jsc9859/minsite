    <h4 class="desc"> I was part of the Queens Museum's Queens 
        Teens program in highschool. For three years I helped
        organize and manage events at the museum while also participating 
        in important discussions about social justice issues within 
        our community. Now while I attend New York University, I help the crew
        at the museum host their family events. The picture above was a summer camp
        organized by the Queens Museum where I led games and overlooked the participating
        children as a Leading Council. It was so much fun!
