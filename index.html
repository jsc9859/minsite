            <h3>Born and raised in Queens, New York from two phenominal parents </h3>
            <p class="pp"> I grew up surrounded by my family in every corner of the neighborhood. A day never went by where I did not see at least one of my aunts or cousins come over for dinner or lunch. Being so family oreinted, I can't imagine my life far away from my family.</p>

            <h3>My lovely Parents </h3>
            <p class="pp"> My parents came from Ecuador over 25 years ago. That is basically 1/4 of their lives spent here in the US! I am very grateful to them for taking a leap of faith for a better future for themselves, their family back in Ecuador, and their future children (me).</p>

        <h3>More about me</h3>
        <p class="hobbies">Most of my hobbies include creating art. 
            I love to paint, sketch, and illustrate on my ipad. 
            Over two years ago I started experimenting with nail art.
            When I have time, I love to decorate my nails!
            It makes me feel good to see my work on display on myself.

        <h3>My cats </h3>
        <p class="hobbies"> As you can see, I am also a proud owner of
            my five year old cat Mufasa. I rescued him over five
            years ago when I heard his cries from outside my home.
            Hiding under a car was a tiny little grey kitten covered in oil. 
            Thankfully, he was too exhausted to fight back and 
            made it safely back to my apartment.
